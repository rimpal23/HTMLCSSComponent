To improve the user experience, we should add a header which tells what the page is about.
We can probably include just the basic points in the Portfolio, About and Projects 
rather than including everything and add the links that navigates to other pages which contain detailed
information about it. The sections can also be styled a bit more so that it looks more interactive and
appeals to the users.
